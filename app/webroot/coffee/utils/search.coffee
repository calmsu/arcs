# search.coffee
# -------------
# One stop shop for searching the ARCS catalog using Visual Search,
# or directly. This is largely a wrapper of Visual Search that bundles
# our facets and callbacks.
#
# The Search utility is a class, so there can be multiple instances of
# it at any time. Each instance maintains a results object, which is our
# own Backbone collection extension. When the run method is called, the
# results object will be reset with the new result set.
class arcs.utils.Search 

    # The constructor accepts options, but none are required for minimal
    # functionality.
    #
    # options
    #
    #   container: DOM Element that wraps the searchbar. When this is omitted,
    #              you get a headless search.
    #   query:     Starting query.
    #   success:   Called after results are successfully fetched.
    #   error:     Called when fetching results fails.
    #   facets:    Set the facets property (this will rarely need to be 
    #              overriden)
