# Keyboard shortcuts and what not.
#
# The Keys class provides an interface for mapping keys (or key combinations)
# to methods. A class instance will bind keydown events on the given element,
# which by default is the document object. When fired, the instance looks 
# for registered mappings matching the keydown. If any are found, the mapped 
# method is called and bubbling stops unless instructed otherwise.
