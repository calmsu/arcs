<h2>Understanding Resources</h2>
<p>In ARCS, a resource is defined as a digital data which could be in form of
photographs/images, videos, word or pdf files, notebooks, page spreads,
inventory cards, maps, artifacts, reports etc. Each resource is associated with
a title, type of file, a link of the location of the file and a unique
identifier as shown below:</p>
<p><img alt="resources1" src="../img/docs/resources-1.png" /></p>
<p>The resources can be seen as a grid pattern or can be enlisted as shown below:</p>
<h4>Grid</h4>
