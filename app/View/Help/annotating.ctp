<h2 id="understanding-annotations">Understanding Annotations</h2>
<p>Annotating a resource is an integral aspect of ARCS. It allows you to define relationships between resources, and make the sometimes messy handwriting of researchers searchable.</p>
<p>An annotation is a special class of resource metadata that marks a boxed region
of a resource image. They are simply a way to relate different resources in
ARCS. You can also link your new annotation to any other resource which
according to you can be associated with that particular annotation. </p>
<h2 id="creating-annotations">Creating Annotations</h2>
<p>Annotations can be created in three different ways in the viewer. You can create a hotspot by boxing over a given area of a resource. This will create a hotspot. You will then be prompted to define the annotation as a relation with another resource, a transcription, or a link to an outside source. as described below:</p>
<h4 id="relations">Relations</h4>
<p>Relations are a simple link to another resource in ARCS. You can select a
resource and open it by double-clicking on it. It will open in a new window.
You can select a region of the resource which you wish to annotate by just
dragging the cursor over it and mark it as a boxed region as follows:</p>
<p><img alt="relation" src="../img/docs/relation-1.png" /></p>
<p>As soon as you box over, the annotation dialogue is revealed as follows:</p>
<p><img alt="relation" src="../img/docs/relation-2.png" /></p>
<p>You can select the resource which has the same image from the resources which
you can see in the annotation dialogue and click on <code>Save</code> to relate the two
resources.</p>
<p>When you hover over an annotation, you can view its type and preview in a
popover as shown below. This content is the relation resource’s title, type and
thumbnail.</p>
<p><img alt="relation" src="../img/docs/relation-3.png" /></p>
<h4 id="transcriptions">Transcriptions</h4>
<p>Often it is very difficult to read and correctly decipher the handwritten text
in a resource. ARCS allows you to select the region of the text of the resource
and re-write the corresponding text in the transcription tab as shown below and
then click on <code>Save</code>:</p>
<p><img alt="transcription" src="../img/docs/transcription-1.png" /></p>
<p><img alt="transcription" src="../img/docs/transcription-2.png" /></p>
<p><img alt="transcription" src="../img/docs/transcription-3.png" /></p>
<p>This would help you to search for the text in the search bar and find the
corresponding resource which has the text.</p>
<h4 id="urls">URLs</h4>
<p>They are external links which are useful in creating a link between the
selected region in the resource and the content in another application. You can
select the region in the resource and add a URL to connect it to the content on
the application and click on <code>Save</code>:</p>
<p><img alt="url" src="../img/docs/url-1.png" /></p>
<p><img alt="url" src="../img/docs/url-2.png" /></p>
<p>A summary of all the annotations corresponding to a resource can be seen in the
sidebar.</p>
<p><img alt="url" src="../img/docs/url-3.png" /></p>
<h2 id="editingdeleting-annotations">Editing/Deleting Annotations</h2>
<p>Annotations can be edited or deleted only by Senior Researchers and
Administrators to avoid any erratic changes in the data of the resources. If
you are a researcher, you can delete only your own annotations or flag another
researcher’s annotation by selecting it and flagging it with a valid. You can
do this by clicking the <strong>&times;</strong> that appears in the left corner when hovering over an
annotation in your resource, and then confirming the deletion.  If you don't
see an <strong>&times;</strong> while hovering on an annotation, you're not allowed to delete it.</p>
