<h1 id="searching-arcs">Searching ARCS</h1>
<p>Searching a resource, collection or notebook has been implemented in a faceted
fashion in ARCS so that it is easier for you to find a specific resource even
when you do not know all the details about the same.</p>
<h2 id="facets">Facets</h2>
<p>A facet can be defined as a particular aspect of the resource such as the user,
or the date of creation of the resource etc.</p>
<p>Facets are a very powerful method of data mining based on searching by data
attribute but the general idea is that youâ€™re filtering resources based on the
data we store about them.</p>
<p>Facets work by typing in the attribute you would like to filter the resources
by, which can be anything as general as the type of resource to something as
specific as a title or you can chain them up together.  For example, you know
that John Doe uploaded an image, and you know that he uploaded it yesterday,
but you do not know anything else. You can construct a search query that will
find everything that John uploaded yesterday.</p>

<p>Searching is still in development to include more general searching, but in
the meantime, you can find a list of available facets below.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The following table gives the description of the different facets that can be
used to search a resource in ARCS:</p>
