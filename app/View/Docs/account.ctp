<p>ARCS uses <a href="http://gravatar.com">Gravatar</a> for profile images. Gravatar is a web service from
Wordpress that connects your email address to an avatar. If you already have
a Gravatar, we'll display it. If not, and you'd like one, you can sign up 
<a href="http://gravatar.com">here</a>, be sure to use the same email address you signed up for ARCS with.</p>
