Uploading
=========
ARCS makes it easy to get your research in the cloud. Navigate to the uploader
from anywhere in ARCS by clicking `Upload` in the top-right corner.

Using the uploader
------------------
To start uploading, drag one or more files into the uploader, or choose some
with the file browser by clicking `Add files...`.

>ARCS supports most image and document formats. You can upload JPEGs, PNGs,
TIFFs, PDFs, Word Documents, RTFs and several other formats. Video and audio
files are not currently supported.

After you've selected your files, they'll appear in the uploader and begin 
uploading immediately. Each upload's progress is shown in a blue bar. This
will change to `Done` when the file is finished uploading. You can remove a file
at any time by clicking the **&times;** next to it.

Each upload has a title, identifier and type field that can be filled in. You
should at least provide a title for each upload, but you can add the rest later.

When everything has finished uploading, the total progress changes to `All
Done` and the `Upload & Fill in Metadata` button is enabled. Although the files
have already been uploaded, they are not resources just yet. That happens when
you click `Upload & Fill in Metadata`. After clicking, you'll be redirected to
the search page, where you can apply additional metadata to the newly uploaded
resources using the batch editing tools.

Using the basic uploader
------------------------
If your browser has trouble with the batch uploader, you can also try our basic
uploader, which allows you to upload files one at time. It's not very fancy,
but it provides a way for users unable to upgrade their browser to upload
resources. Navigate to the basic uploader by clicking `Basic` on the uploading
page.

![basic-uploader](../img/docs/basic-uploader.png)

You can then enter the title and the keyword associated with the resource and select  the type of the resource from the drop down as shown below:

Troubleshooting
---------------
If you have trouble uploading, here's what you can do:

#### Upload failed
Sometimes uploads can get lost in transit, or the server fails to process your
request. In this case, just refresh the page and try again. If the problem 
persists, let us know.

#### File size too large
Each upload can be up to 100 megabytes in size. If a file is larger than that, 
you'll see an error message. Often, these large files are high resolution PDFs. 
When that's the case, here are two solutions:

- Reduce the file size using Acrobat (or Preview, on a Mac).
- If you'd rather not reduce the image quality, you can also upload the PDF in
  pieces, and use `Add to collection...` to put the pieces back together. 

#### Upload timed out
Each upload may take a maximum of 6 minutes. If your internet connection is 
slow and the file is especially large, it may timeout.

#### Missing thumbnails or pages of a split PDF
Sometimes our image processor will fail to make a thumbnail or will skip a page
of a PDF. You can ask it to try again, through the reprocess dialog on every
resource page.
