Collections 
===========

Understanding Collections 
------------------------- 
A collection can be defined as a combination of a number of resources like
photographs and documents specific to a segment of the research. A researcher
can create any number of collections for a particular research study. They are
a medium to correlate the different resources under specific segments of the
research.

### Notebook 
A notebook is a special form of collection. It is idiosyncratic and has a
structural characteristic particular to an individual user or a group of users.

Creating Collections 
-------------------- 
You can create a collection by selecting a set of resources and then clicking on `Collection` and selecting the `Create new collection` from the drop down as shown below: You
can also add resources to your collection by selecting the `Add to existing
collection` in the drop down.

### Bookmark 
A bookmark is a special form of collection which does not necessarily be a part
of a research study. It can be a set of resources which you would want to study
and use it in some form in the future. You can select any number of resources
and then click on `Collection` and select the `Add to bookmarks` option in the drop down.


You can add name to your collection by adding a title to it and give a brief
description of the collection you just created as follows:

![create-collection](../img/docs/create-collection.png)

**Title** : A title can be defined as a general semantic which associates itself to the content of the resources.

**Description** : The description should be a short explanation of the resources and their association within the collection.

You can flag or edit attributes of each resource in a collection as a single
operation. You can learn more about it in the [Bulk Actions](bulk-actions)
section.
