Uploading
=========

Using the batch uploader
------------------------
The batch uploader allows you to upload several resources at once. 

As it relies on features of newer web browsers, we recommend using the latest 
version of Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox.

Using the standard uploader
---------------------------
If you're only uploading a single file, or having trouble with the batch 
uploader, the standard uploader is available.

Troubleshooting
---------------

### Upload failed.
Sometimes uploads can get lost in transit. In this case, refresh the page and 
try again.

### Upload timed out.
Each upload may take a maximum of 6 minutes. If you're trying to upload an
especially large file, try splitting the file into parts and upload them
to the same collection.

### File size too large.
Each upload can be up to 100 megabytes in size. Try splitting up larger files
and upload them in pieces.

### Missing thumbnails or pages of a split PDF.
Sometimes our image processor will fail to make a thumbnail or will skip a
page of a PDF. You can ask it to try again, through the reprocess dialog on
every resource page.
