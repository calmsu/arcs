Searching the ARCS catalog
==========================
We've tried to make it easy to find resources in ARCS, even when you
know very little about them. 

Say you know that John Doe uploaded an image, and you know that he 
uploaded it yesterday, but not much else. We can construct a search 
query that will find everything that John uploaded yesterday.
