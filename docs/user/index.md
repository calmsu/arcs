Getting Started 
=============== 
ARCS is a dynamic and interactive ecosystem which builds physical relationships
between the data resources. Using ARCS, you can retrieve resources using the
search facility with the use of simplified facets. Registered researchers can
use ARCS to submit their resources which can be later retrieved and updated.
You can also acquire details regarding specific features of ARCS through its
different segments as mentioned in the table of contents.

You can find brief explanations regarding the specific terms used throughout
ARCS as follows:

Resources 
--------- 
A resource can be any form of digital data related to a research that a
researcher is working on. It can be photographs, page spreads, inventory cards,
maps, artifacts, reports, word documents, notebooks etc. You can learn more
details at the [Resources](about-resources) section. 

Annotation 
---------- 
An annotation is a short explanatory note made by any researcher and they can
be added by researchers to any resource when they are open to them. You can
learn more details at the [Annotation](annotating) section.

Collections 
----------- 
A collection can be formed by combining any form of the above mentioned
resources relevant to a particular segment of a research. You can learn more
details at the [Collections](about-collections) section.

Uploading 
--------- 
Resources can be uploaded in ARCS in two ways, either through the standard
uploader for uploading a single file or through the batch uploader for
uploading a number of files. You can learn more details in the
[Upload](uploading) section.
