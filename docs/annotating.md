Annotating
==========

Understanding Annotations
-------------------------
An annotation is a special class of resource metadata that marks a boxed region
of a resource image. They are simply a way to relate different resources in
ARCS. You can also link your new annotation to any other resource which
according to you can be associated with that particular annotation. 

Creating Annotations
--------------------
Annotations can be created in three different ways as described below:

#### Relations 
Relations are a simple link to another resource in ARCS. You can select a
resource and open it by double-clicking on it. It will open in a new window.
You can select a region of the resource which you wish to annotate by just
dragging the cursor over it and mark it as a boxed region as follows:

![annotating](../img/docs/annotating.png)

As soon as you box over, the annotation dialogue is revealed as follows:

![relation](../img/docs/relation.png)

You can select the resource which has the same image from the resources which
you can see in the annotation dialogue and click on ‘Save’ to relate the two
resources.

When you hover over an annotation, you can view its type and preview in a
popover as shown below. This content is the relation resource’s title, type and
thumbnail.

#### Transcriptions
Often it is very difficult to read and correctly decipher the handwritten text
in a resource. ARCS allows you to select the region of the text of the resource
and re-write the corresponding text in the transcription tab as shown below and
then click on ‘Save’:

![annotations4](../img/docs/annotations-4.png)

![annotations5](../img/docs/annotations-5.png)

![annotations6](../img/docs/annotations-6.png)

This would help you to search for the text in the search bar and find the
corresponding resource which has the text.

#### URLs
They are external links which are useful in creating a link between the
selected region in the resource and the content in another application. You can
select the region in the resource and add a URL to connect it to the content on
the application and click on ‘Save’:

![annotations7](../img/docs/annotations-7.png)

![annotations8](../img/docs/annotations-8.png)

A summary of all the annotations corresponding to a resource can be seen in the
sidebar.

Editing/Deleting Annotations
----------------------------
Annotations can be edited or deleted only by Senior Researchers and
Administrators to avoid any erratic changes in the data of the resources. If
you are a researcher, you can delete only your own annotations or flag another
researcher’s annotation by selecting it and flagging it with a valid. You can
do this by clicking the X that appears in the left corner when hovering over an
annotation in your resource, and then confirming the deletion.  If you don't
see an X while hovering on an annotation, you're not allowed to delete it.
